## Usage

## Large array

Large array can be autogenerated in profile file like this:

```yaml
0x60E3:
    name: Supported homing methods
    data:
    - type: uint8
        name: Highest sub-index supported
        access: ro
        default: 1
        length: 255
    - type: int8
        name: "?#st suported homing method"
        access: ro
```

The second data of this object will be repeated 255 times and ?# will be replaced by the index of the array.
