# CiA Profiles

CiA (CAN in Automation) profiles are standardized sets of parameters and settings that define how a device should behave in a CANopen network. They are used to ensure interoperability between devices from different manufacturers. The profiles are defined by the CiA organization and are widely used in industrial automation, automotive, and other applications.

This folder contains a collection of CiA profiles organized as YAML files.
The validation schema is provided in `validation/schema.py`.

These files are used to complete a user implementation and validate the mandatory parameters against the CiA standard.
